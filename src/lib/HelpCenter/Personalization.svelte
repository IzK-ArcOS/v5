<h1>Personalization</h1>
<p>
  One of the key things we care about in ArcOS is customization; the ability to
  change every aspect of your desktop precisely how you like it. I like to think
  we did a pretty good job, with a ton of options and things to tweak.
</p>
<p>
  In this help center article, you will learn what customization options there
  are, and more.
</p>
<h2>The shell</h2>
<p>
  The shell is <b>the Taskbar</b>, <b>Start Menu</b>, <b>Action Center</b> and
  <b>ArcFind</b>. It too can be customized. You can customize the shell by going
  to the Shell page in Settings. From there you can change the behaviour of
  every component of the shell.

<h2>Desktop</h2>
<p>
  The very first thing you see every time you log in. On the desktop you'll find
  your desktop icons and the wallpaper. The wallpaper can be changed using
  either a built-in wallpaper or a custom one via URL or ArcFS file.
</p>
<p>
  Do you want to save your current options? Good news, you can! On the
  Appearance page of the Settings app, you can click on the save icon to save
  your current appearance as a theme so that you can easily switch between
  different styles.
